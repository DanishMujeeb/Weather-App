This was a personal project where I create a weather app. I used the open weather map API and React to create the app. 
I also used CSS to style the page.

- Languages Used: JavaScript (React) and CSS
- Main Concepts Covered: ES6, Events, Hooks, Axios and CSS properties

This is how the app will first appear

After entering a city the current weather and the weather for the next 2 days will appear. Additional information
will appear below that.

An error message will pop up if an invalid city is inputted
