This was a personal project where I create a weather app. I used the open weather map API and React to create the app. 
I also used CSS to style the page.

- Languages Used: JavaScript (React) and CSS
- Main Concepts Covered: ES6, Events, Hooks, Axios and CSS properties

This is how the app will first appear
