This was a personal project where I create a weather app. The app allows a user to enter in a city to see the weather in that city for today and the next 2 days. 

The below steps can be followed to run the program

1. Click the green "Code" button
2. Go to the Codespaces tab and click the "Create codespace on main" button
3. Open the terminal in Codespaces
4. After all of the files are available run "npm start" in the terminal
